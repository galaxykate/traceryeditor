What are the universal parts of a social network?

Ways that people can 
* send messages
* set boundaries (what they see, what can be seen, what can cross barriers)
* send to one, some, many
* browse vs feed

customization
* self-presentation, sense of self
* coziness, "spark joy" (things that bring pleasure or personal meaning)
* reflection objects (reminders, mementoes, mantras in object form)
* "closets"/"workshops" self-honed functional spaces for search or creation
* "the parlor" (personal space plus entertaining/impressing visitors)
* winamp skins (ui skinning, stardew diversity mods)

ways to consume content
* "cuckoo clock"
* "froot-by-the-foot" endless linear feed
* grazing (directional surfing, ie wikihole)
